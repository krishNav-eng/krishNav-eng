- 👋 Hi, I’m @krishNav-eng.
- 👀 I’m interested in sharing fun projects and implementation of algorithms in different programming language. (primarily for now is Python)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Kotlin. (though they are a vast area themselves)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that interests me. {As I'm not limiting myself to any particular area :)}
- 📫 To reach me, you can mail me at krishnavsharma2006@gmail.com
